% Nowadays the amount of different IoT devices around us is 
% constantly increasing in all areas starting from smart home and ending up with industry automation. 
% All these devices target different use cases,
% have different underlying implementations and connected using different communication protocols.
% In this light 
The Web of Things (WoT)~\cite{Wot2017arch} aims to provide interoperability between IoT devices.
It does this by defining a metadata format,
the WoT \emph{Thing Description}, that can describe 
a wide range of IoT network interfaces.
A Thing Description can describe the network interfaces of existing devices
or can be produced and consumed by devices running a WoT runtime supporting a WoT scripting
API that normalizes interactions with other devices with a common abstraction layer.
